By injecting micro-doses of neuromodulators at the nerve endings beneath wrinkles, we temporarily block impulses, causing the facial muscles to relax. The outcome? Renewed, rejuvenated skin with a softer, smoother appearance. At CADMEN Clinic, we offer a range of options including Botox, Xeomin, and Dysport neuromodulators, allowing you to select the best fit for your unique needs.',
            'Botox: Renowned as a versatile option, Botox effectively targets facial muscles to minimize wrinkles and fine lines. Its subtle approach offers a rejuvenated look, while maintaining your natural expression.',

            'Dysport: With its unique diffusion pattern, Dysport is designed to address larger treatment areas effectively. It rapidly spreads to target a broader surface, making it an excellent choice for reducing the appearance of dynamic wrinkles across the face.'

This innovative filler provides long-lasting results, typically lasting up to 15 months, making it an excellent choice for those seeking both immediate and enduring facial rejuvenation.'

The VI Peel solution is then applied in two layers.\n3. You may experience a mild numbing or tingling sensation following the application of the first layer.\n4. When the second layer is applied, your skin may exhibit a \"frosting\" effect, turning white.\n5. After approximately 4 to 6 hours, you'll wash off the peel.\n6.
