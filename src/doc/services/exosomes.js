            question: "How do exosomes help with hair loss?",
            answer: "Exosomes contain over 200+ growth factors and signaling molecules that help regenerate and repair tissue. When applied to the scalp, they encourage hair follicles to re-enter the growth phase, leading to thicker, stronger hair over time."
