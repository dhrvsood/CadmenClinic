You may feel a slight prickling sensation in more sensitive areas, such as around the nose and forehead wrinkle areas. Our experienced practitioners adjust the technique to ensure your comfort throughout the session."

Most clients experience mild redness (similar to a sunburn) for 24–48 hours after treatment. This typically subsides quickly, and many return to normal activities the very next day. Some clients may experience slight swelling or sensitivity that resolves within a few days."

            question: "How soon will I see results?",
            answer: `Many clients notice an immediate "glow" and improved skin texture within days of their first treatment. However, the most significant results appear gradually as your body produces new collagen and elastin. You'll typically see noticeable improvement in skin texture and tone within 2–4 weeks, with continued enhancement for up to 6 months following your treatment series.`
