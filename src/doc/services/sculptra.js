Sculptra results can last up to 2 years or more, depending on the individual and the number of treatment sessions. Sculptra stimulates natural collagen production, which helps maintain the effects over time, offering a more youthful and refreshed appearance."

            answer: "Prior to administering the injections, we apply a numbing cream to the area to alleviate any potential discomfort throughout the procedure. Additionally, we employ a cold pack both before and after the injections. If you wish, you can take Tylenol before and after the treatment to help alleviate any potential pain. It's important to note that there might be some bruising and swelling, which typically subside within 1–2 weeks."
