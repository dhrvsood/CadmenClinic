PRP is one of the most talked-about hair restoration treatments in
Toronto---but does it really work? At **CADMEN Clinic**, we've treated
hundreds of clients and seen firsthand how effective PRP can be. Let's
separate fact from fiction.

**The Science Behind PRP**

PRP contains platelets rich in growth factors that repair and regenerate
tissues---including hair follicles. Multiple clinical studies confirm
PRP's role in reducing shedding and boosting regrowth.

**Common Myths**

- **Myth: PRP is painful** → Truth: Minimal discomfort, quick
recovery.
- **Myth: Results are immediate** → Truth: Takes 3--6 months to see
visible change.
- **Myth: It's only for men** → Truth: Women also see excellent
results.

**Real Results**

Most clients notice reduced shedding after the first two sessions and
visible regrowth within 3--6 months.

Don't let myths hold you back. **Schedule your free consultation at
