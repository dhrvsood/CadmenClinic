Hair loss affects both men and women, and for many, it can feel
frustrating and overwhelming. But today, there's a natural, non-surgical
solution that has gained widespread popularity across the world:
Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy. At **CADMEN Clinic** in Toronto, we
specialize in advanced PRP hair restoration treatments designed to
stimulate your body's own healing process and awaken dormant hair
follicles. If you're considering PRP, this guide covers everything you
need to know before booking your first session.

### What Is PRP Hair Restoration?

PRP therapy uses the healing power of your own blood to encourage hair
regrowth. A small sample of your blood is taken and spun in a centrifuge
to separate the plasma rich in platelets. This platelet-rich plasma is
then carefully injected into areas of thinning hair on the scalp.

Platelets contain natural growth factors and proteins that trigger cell
regeneration and improve circulation to the follicles. By harnessing
your own biology, PRP delivers natural, safe, and effective
results---without chemicals or surgery.

### How Does PRP Work?

The process is straightforward and completed in less than an hour:

1. Consultation -- Your scalp is assessed, and a personalized plan is
created.
2. Blood Draw -- A small vial of blood is taken, just like a routine
test.
3. Centrifuge Separation -- Platelets are extracted using specialized
kits.
4. Scalp Injections -- PRP is injected into thinning or balding areas.

The treatment involves minimal discomfort and no downtime---you can
return to work immediately.

### Who Is a Good Candidate?

PRP works best for clients experiencing:

- Early to moderate thinning
- Male and female pattern baldness
- Shedding after stress, pregnancy, or illness
- Weak or miniaturized hair follicles

It is also an excellent choice for clients who want 100% natural
treatment without synthetic chemicals.

### Results and Timeline

PRP is a progressive treatment. Here's what most clients experience:

- After 1--2 sessions: Reduced shedding, improved scalp health
- After 3--4 sessions: Noticeable thickening and stronger strands
- 3--6 months: Visible regrowth and improved hair density

Consistency is key. Maintenance treatments 1--2 times per year are
recommended for long-term results.
