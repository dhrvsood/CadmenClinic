Taking the first step toward addressing hair loss can feel
intimidating. At CADMEN Clinic, we've designed our consultation process
to make clients feel comfortable, informed, and confident. Your
consultation isn't a sales pitch — it's a personalized roadmap to
restoring your hair and confidence. Here's exactly what you can expect
when you book your free consultation with us in Toronto.

**Step 1: Warm Welcome & Intake**

Your experience starts with a warm welcome from our team. In a private,
relaxed setting, we'll collect a brief medical history to ensure
treatments like PRP, exosomes, or mesotherapy are safe and suitable for
you.

**Step 2: Scalp & Hair Assessment**

A specialist will carefully examine your scalp and hair to:

- Identify thinning patterns
- Evaluate follicle health and density
- Check for underlying scalp issues that could impact results

This assessment is essential for tailoring the right treatment plan.

**Step 3: Discussion of Goals**

Every client's journey is different. Some want to stop shedding, others
want to restore a hairline, and some aim for thicker overall density.
We'll listen to your goals and explain how each treatment option can
help.

**Step 4: Treatment Plan Options**

We'll walk you through the best options based on your needs:

- PRP Therapy: Perfect for early to moderate thinning.
- Exosomes: Ideal for more advanced cases or clients wanting stronger,
faster results.
- Mesotherapy: Great for scalp rejuvenation and as a maintenance
therapy.

We'll also explain how combination approaches can maximize outcomes.

**Step 5: Transparent Pricing & Packages**

At CADMEN Clinic, we're upfront about costs. We'll outline how many
sessions you may need, package options, and current promotions — like
our 50% Off Summer Special.

**Step 6: Q&A**

You'll have plenty of time to ask questions and address any concerns,
whether about pain, downtime, or results.

Your consultation at CADMEN Clinic is the first step toward a healthier
scalp, thicker hair, and renewed confidence. By the end, you'll have a
clear treatment plan designed for your needs — without any guesswork.
