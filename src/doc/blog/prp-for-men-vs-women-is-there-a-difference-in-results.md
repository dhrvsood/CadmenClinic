Hair loss affects both men and women, but treatment responses can differ
slightly. At **CADMEN Clinic**, we tailor every plan based on gender,
genetics, and lifestyle.

**PRP for Men**

- Best for early male pattern baldness
- Slows hairline recession and crown thinning
- Works well with long-term maintenance

**PRP for Women**

- Ideal for diffuse thinning
- Restores volume and density across the scalp
- Particularly effective for post-pregnancy shedding

Whether you're male or female, PRP can work for you. **Book your free
consultation at CADMEN Clinic today.**
