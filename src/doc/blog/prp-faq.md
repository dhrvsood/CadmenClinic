**How Many PRP Sessions Do You Really Need for Visible Results?**

One of the most common questions we hear at **CADMEN Clinic** is: *"How
many PRP sessions will I need before I see results?"* The answer depends
on your level of hair loss, your goals, and your body's response.

**General Treatment Plan**

- **Initial Phase**: 3-4 sessions spaced 4-6 weeks apart
- **Maintenance**: 1-2 sessions per year

**Why Multiple Sessions?**

Hair growth cycles take time. PRP stimulates dormant follicles, but
consistent stimulation ensures stronger, longer-lasting results.

**Factors That Influence Session Count**

- **Severity of hair loss**: Early thinning needs fewer sessions.
- **Age**: Younger clients respond faster.
- **Health and lifestyle**: Nutrition, stress, and genetics all play a
role.
