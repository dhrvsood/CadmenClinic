If you've been researching natural hair restoration, you've likely come
across PRP and exosomes. Both treatments are highly effective and
**available at CADMEN Clinic**, but how do you know which one is right
for you? This guide breaks down the differences, benefits, and ideal
candidates for each.

### **PRP: The Trusted Standard**

- Uses your own blood plasma, making it 100% natural.
- Excellent for early to moderate thinning.
- Requires multiple sessions for best results.
- Results typically appear in 3--6 months.

### **Exosomes: The Cutting-Edge Upgrade**

- Lab-derived vesicles packed with growth signals.
- Ideal for more advanced thinning or stubborn areas.
- Often requires fewer treatments than PRP.
- Results can appear faster and with greater density.

### **Side-by-Side Comparison**

| Feature | PRP | Exosomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source | Your blood platelets | Stem-cell derived |
| Best for | Early thinning | Advanced thinning |
| Sessions needed | 3-6 | 1-2 |
| Cost | Lower | Higher |
| Time to results | 3-6 months | 1-3 months |

### **Which Should You Choose?**

- If you're just beginning to notice thinning and want a natural,
proven solution → **PRP**.
- If you have more significant hair loss or want faster, more dramatic
results → **Exosomes**.
- Many clients combine both treatments for maximum impact.

Both PRP and exosomes are effective hair restoration therapies---but
your unique needs will determine the best path forward. At **CADMEN
