Not all hair restoration treatments are the same. While PRP and exosomes
have gained popularity, mesotherapy has quietly become one of the most
effective non-surgical solutions for improving scalp health and
promoting hair regrowth. At **CADMEN Clinic**, we combine mesotherapy
with advanced techniques to give our clients natural, lasting results.

**What Is Mesotherapy for Hair?**

Mesotherapy is a treatment where vitamins, minerals, peptides, and
growth factors are injected directly into the scalp to nourish and
revitalize hair follicles.

**How Does It Work?**

- Improves blood circulation in the scalp
- Strengthens weakened follicles
- Stimulates new hair growth
- Delivers nutrients directly where they're needed most

**Who Should Consider Mesotherapy?**

- Men and women with early to moderate thinning
- Clients experiencing stress-related hair shedding
- Those looking for a boost after PRP or exosome therapy

**Results to Expect**

- Reduced hair shedding within weeks
- Stronger, thicker strands over 3--6 months
- Improved scalp condition and density

Clinic** and learn if mesotherapy is right for you.
