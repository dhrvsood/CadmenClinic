When considering any medical treatment, it's natural to wonder about
side effects. Hair restoration treatments like PRP (Platelet-Rich
Plasma), exosomes, and mesotherapy are considered safe, minimally
invasive, and well-tolerated. But at **CADMEN Clinic**, we believe in
full transparency: clients should know what to expect — both the normal,
temporary after-effects and the rare but possible risks.

# Why Understanding Side Effects Matters

Knowing what's normal helps set realistic expectations. Many clients
worry when they see minor redness or tenderness, but these are
completely routine and typically resolve within days. By educating
yourself, you can approach treatment with confidence and peace of mind.

**Common, Temporary Side Effects**

These mild effects are part of the natural healing process and usually
fade within 24-72 hours:

- **Mild swelling or redness**: This occurs at injection sites and
typically looks like small bumps on the scalp.
- **Tenderness or sensitivity**: Your scalp may feel sore to the
touch, similar to a mild sunburn.
- **Minor bruising**: Small pinprick bruises can appear where the
needle entered.
- **Itching or tingling**: Some clients report a slight "tightness" or
itching as follicles are stimulated.

These side effects are expected, temporary, and a sign that your body is
responding.

**How CADMEN Clinic Minimizes Risks**

- **Sterile techniques**: Our medical team follows strict clinical
protocols.
- **High-quality kits**: We use premium PRP and exosome systems for
safety and consistency.
- **Skilled practitioners**: All procedures are performed by
experienced nurses and dermatology professionals.
- **Aftercare guidance**: Every client receives detailed instructions
to minimize discomfort and maximize results.

**Aftercare Tips to Reduce Side Effects**

- Avoid touching or scratching the scalp for 24 hours.
- Skip heavy workouts and sweating for 1-2 days.
- Avoid alcohol and smoking right after treatment, as they can slow
healing.
- Use gentle shampoo after 24 hours — avoid harsh chemicals.

The side effects of hair restoration treatments are typically mild and
short-lived, especially compared to the long-term benefits of fuller,
healthier hair. At **CADMEN Clinic**, your safety and comfort are always
our top priority.
